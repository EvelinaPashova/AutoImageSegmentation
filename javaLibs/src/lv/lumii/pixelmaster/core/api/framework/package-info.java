/**
 * <p>This package contains the interfaces that define how modules
 * interact with the core. These interfaces are essential for the modules'
 * functionality to be accessible from the application.</p>
 *
 * <p>There are two kinds of interfaces in this package:
 * <ol>
 * <li>the ones implemented by the core and used by the modules,</li>
 * <li>the ones implemented by the modules and used by the core.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * The first kind of interfaces give modules access to the core's facilities.
 * The second kind of interfaces are extension points that must be implemented
 * my all modules.</p>
